class STTransform3
{
	// Fill in your class definition here. STTransform3 should implement a 3x3 matrix that
	// you can use to modify 2D vertices with homogenous coordinates (hence the 3x3 size
	// rather than 2x2). This class doesn't need to be complicated. Other than basic 
	// accessor functions, you'll probably want to implement multiplication between transforms.
	// You have a lot of flexibility as to how you implement this class, but you will need to
	// follow the conventions used in the rest of libst.
